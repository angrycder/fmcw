		What possible purpose could skills in the digital arts serve for engineers? 
		This was the question that stood in front of the founding members of Film & Media Council when they took the initiative to start an organization dedicated to honing the skills of IIT (BHU)â€™s students in the field of digital arts. Over the few years of its existence, however, the creativity, ingenuity and innovation manifested by the members of FMC have proved that a skillset in this field is an invaluable asset for a 21st century millennial. Through its arsenal of 6 clubs, namely - Photography, Cinematography, Media, Design, Animation and Outreach, FMC allows the students of IIT (BHU) to follow their passions whilst pursuing a formal degree in engineering.
